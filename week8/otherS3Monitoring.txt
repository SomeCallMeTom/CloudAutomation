There's a ton that could be 'monitored', and be used to trigger create_event_source_mapping

One that comes to mind is if someone is trying to upload a particularly large file, that may be something that could be a threat.
From a security point of view you may want a notification if access to the bucket is updated, and to recieve information about the new users that have access.

You might want to implement "scanning" where the files that have not been accessed in some ammount of days are moved into "cold storage"
You could have a regular script to backup S3 data to a local storage for redundancy.
